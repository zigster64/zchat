# Z-Chat React App

Communicate the easy and natural way, using only Hexidecimal and Cuniform

People have been communicating using only Cuniform for thousands of centuries, and they have got on just fine.

They managed to build a complete civilization using just cuniform even !

Z-Chat allows you to communicate with other people using Cuniform, with the modern convenience of 
hexidecimal, and some extra emojis for good measure.

![Z-Chat](../docs/zchat.png)

Click on any Cuniform (or Emoji) to transmit the data for that code.

Click on any PAIR of Hexidecimal values to combine them and transmit the character for that combined code.

for example - if you Click 4 8 6 9

This will transmit 2 letters - 48 (H) and 69 (i)
Which will print "Hi"

What could be easier ?
